# TransEdit

TransEdit is a small, local-first Next.js app for reviewing and editing translation (locale) JSON files.

Key features

- Upload source (e.g. `en.json`) and target locale files to create a `.transedit` review file.
- Interactive review dashboard with autosave and undo/redo.
- Snapshot support to capture versions while reviewing.
- Search and filter translations.
- Export updated locale JSON files.
- Share reviews by uploading the `.transedit` file to Catbox and generating a short share link (`/review?shareId=...`).
- Local storage via IndexedDB (Dexie); no remote database required for core functionality.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies and run the dev server (pnpm preferred):

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

2. Open http://localhost:3000 and use the Create page to import files or the Review page to open a `.transedit` file.

Notes

- The app uses Catbox to host shared `.transedit` files when you generate share links. Shared links fetch the review file server-side and merge any existing local progress.
- This repository is primarily for personal use and experimentation; the README is intentionally minimal.

2. Use the search bar to find specific translations
